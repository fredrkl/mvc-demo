# Template Base

This repository is a template for my projects, containing the basic structure
and files I typically use as a starting point.

## Renovate setup

The `renovate.json` file is used to configure Renovate, a tool for automating
dependency updates. Renovate helps keep dependencies up to date by creating
pull requests with the latest versions of dependencies.
